Description: This package implements 11 popular distance metric
       learning methods. The methods are:
       Free Energy Nearest Neighbor (FENN),
       Free Energy Nearest Neighbor with dimension reduction (subFENN),
       Discriminant Adaptive Nearest Neighbor (DANN),
       iterative Discriminant Adaptive Nearest Neighbor (iDANN),
       Locally Adaptive Metric Nearest Neighbor (ADAMENN),
       Locally Adaptive Metric Nearest Neighbor (iADAMENN),
       Xing's method,
       Relevant Component Analaysis (RCA),
       Linear Fisher Discriminant Analaysis (LFDA),
       Discriminant Component Analaysis (DCA),
       Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA).
       All methods are implemented using RcppArmadillo in order to attain improved performance.
       A vignette detailing the usage of each method is attached to the package.
